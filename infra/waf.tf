# WAF in front of the ALB — three free AWS-managed rule groups (common
# exploits, known-bad-inputs, SQL injection) plus a rate-based rule that
# blocks any single IP making an unusual volume of requests. The rate-based
# rule is also the interim mitigant for login/password-reset brute-forcing
# until app-level rate limiting (blocked on picking a Redis-type store) is
# in place — coarser (by IP, not by account) but live now rather than later.
